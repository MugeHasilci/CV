## Skills

#### Problem solving and Fast Learner

I have always enjoyed fixing things and understanding how they work, which is what lead me to enjoy maths and science when I was younger, and programming now. I have a good logical and analytical mind, and so I'm skilled at quickly working out where a problem lies and how to fix it. I am able to pick up new skills quickly, and this has helped me to stay ahead throughout the course.

In my previous role as a customer service executive, I have won many awards for being the best member of my team for solving customers queries and getting the highest NPS month on month. I developed my own toolkit to help me responds to customers queries quickly and efficiently there by able to solve more issues in a day than any of my other team members.

I enjoy solving problems, troubleshooting issues, and coming up with solutions in a timely manner.I thrive in team settings, and I think my ability to effectively  communicate with others is what drives my ability to solve a variety of problems.I like to explore alternative solutions to problems and have an open mind about what will work best.

#### Collaborating and partnering

In my previous role as Hotel Management Trainee at Istanbul Marriot Hotel Asia, I worked collaboratively with my team to deliver the best customer service experience to our guests. By working in team I learnt how a cooperative process enable each of us an individuals to achieve extraordinary results being part of a well co-ordinated team.  I learned that by sharing common goals, values, beliefs and motivation I can succeed to in my soft skills, experience and career. Being part of team we can complement each others strength and learn from each other to have an all round learning and experience to further our career goal. 

#### Clean Code Advocate

Over the course of the Makers bootcamp, I have developed a strong understanding of the ideas behind writing clean code, and take care to ensure that the code I write is test driven, DRY, and follows SOLID principles. An example of my use of TDD and clean code can be found in my GitHub MugeHasilci.
