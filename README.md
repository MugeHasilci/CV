## Skills

#### Problem solving and Fast Learner

I have always enjoyed fixing things and understanding how they work, which is what lead me to enjoy maths and science when I was younger, and programming now. I have a good logical and analytical mind, and so I'm skilled at quickly working out where a problem lies and how to fix it. I am able to pick up new skills quickly, and this has helped me to stay ahead throughout the course.

In my previous role as a customer service executive, I have won many awards for being the best member of my team for solving customers queries and getting the highest NPS month on month. I developed my own toolkit to help me responds to customers queries quickly and efficiently there by able to solve more issues in a day than any of my other team members.

I enjoy solving problems, troubleshooting issues, and coming up with solutions in a timely manner.I thrive in team settings, and I think my ability to effectively  communicate with others is what drives my ability to solve a variety of problems.I like to explore alternative solutions to problems and have an open mind about what will work best.

#### Collaborating and partnering

In my previous role as Hotel Management Trainee at Istanbul Marriot Hotel Asia, I worked collaboratively with my team to deliver the best customer service experience to our guests. By working in team I learnt how a cooperative process enable each of us an individuals to achieve extraordinary results being part of a well co-ordinated team.
